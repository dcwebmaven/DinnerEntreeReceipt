# DinnerEntreeReceipt
This PHP script is a basic dinner entree menu for a restaurant.  Users can select the entree and it calculates and prints a receipt based on the choices the user makes.

Specs for Dinner Entree Receipt

Create an HTML file with a form so the end user can select a dinner entree: steak, salmon, barbecue pork, or chicken. Modify your PHP receipt program from the Lesson 2 project (be sure to save the file under a new name) so that it uses an if/else statement to automatically select a different beverage to accompany each entree. 

Use easy to understand variable names and comment your code.

BONUS: Try making it so that your program prints prices with only two decimal places. Check out the link here:http://php.net/manual/en/function/sprintf.php
